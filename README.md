## Summary

This web app is my culminating capstone project for the Software Engineering Program at Thinkful. Maslool is the Hebrew word for "path", as in the path that we take when we are aimlessly wandering in nature. I have decided to create a forum-like website in order to create a tight-knit community of outdoor enthusiasts. It is designed to be very straightforward and interactive. It features a comprehensive search and filtre feature for all trails available, a rating feature, and a comment feature that is designed to be friendly to all sorts of user. It is also designed with plenty of staff interaction in mind, where users can flag comments that they think are inappropriate, and send messages to moderators to suggest new content and features, give feedback, report issues, etc. There are added features for moderators such as the ability to add, delete, and edit trails, ban and unban users, unflag comments, receive messages from users, retrieve all users with a comprehensive search feature, edit and delete everyone's comments, and best of all an opportunity to help expand the scope of our web app.
